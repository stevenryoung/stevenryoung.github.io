# The Purpose
This site will serve as my professional website. I am going to keep it updated with my current research information.

# The Blog
The blog will not be updated frequently. It will be used to provide information about any news concerning me, any professional events I attend, etc.

# The Technology
The site is developed using Jekyll, is hosted using github pages, and uses [this template](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog) as a starting point.
